## Greetings, Earthlings! ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Commander X, the proud mascot of Space X-Chimpâ„¢. Once an ordinary chimpanzee, I dreamed of reaching the stars. With help from my incredible team, I transformed into an astronaut, exploring the cosmos and bringing back knowledge to power your digital journeys. Just like me, Space X-Chimpâ„¢ goes beyond limits, offering stellar web software and services that take your website to new heights. Join us on this adventure, and letâ€™s reach for the stars together!

### The Team

We are a small, international team based in Tallinn, Estonia, but we prefer to work remotely due to our love of travel.

Our motto is: **"Follow your dreams and donâ€™t give up."**
